⮚ Stage#1 (Planning & Analysis):

o Applied the following planning and analysis
technique :

● Problem definition and planning.
● Environment type.
● Agent type.
● PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators,
Sensors).

                        
⮚ Stage#2 (Design):


o Applied the following design techniques to formulate
the problem and its solution:

● Problem state space (State graph).
● Initial state.
● Goal test to verify reaching goal state.
● Successor function with (Set of actions & Paths costs).
● Transition model
● A solution / plan to show the transformation from initial
state to goal state.

⮚ Stage#1:

● Described any information & assumptions needed to apply A*
on your case study, for example describe on what logical
basis you assumed or calculated the heuristic function(s).

● Applied A* search algorithm on the state diagram with initial state and goal state.

⮚ Stage#2 (Implementation):

● Implementation on Python .

● Implemented A* search with dynamic input parameters for
both initial state and goal state.

● Print the trajectory path of nodes (Solution / plan), after the
execution of the algorithm.
