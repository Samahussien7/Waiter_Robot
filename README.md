# Waiter_Robot
Waiter robot software design working autonomously  using A* algorithm to deliver tables consuming the least energy and time possible.

⮚ Stage#1 (Planning & Analysis):

o Apply the following planning and analysis
technique to your problem:

● Problem definition and planning.
● Environment type.
● Agent type.
● PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators,
Sensors).

                        
⮚ Stage#2 (Design):


o Apply the following design techniques to formulate
the problem and its solution:

● Problem state space (State graph and/or State tree).
● Initial state.
● Goal test to verify reaching goal state.
● Successor function with (Set of actions & Paths costs).
● Transition model
● A solution / plan to show the transformation from initial
state to goal state.

[Phase2.pdf](https://github.com/Samahussien7/Waiter_Robot/files/12195019/Phase2.pdf)
⮚ Stage#1:

● Describe any information & assumptions needed to apply A*
on your case study, for example describe on what logical
basis you assumed or calculated the heuristic function(s).

● Apply A* search algorithm on the state diagram and / or
state tree with initial state and goal state with respect to
your case study (on paper or electronic document).

● Note if your case study has multiple objectives choose one
of them that you can achieve by apply search.

⮚ Stage#2 (Implementation):

● Implementation should be on Python .

● Implement A* search with dynamic input parameters for
both initial state and goal state.

● Print the trajectory path of nodes (Solution / plan), after the
execution of the algorithm.

● According to result you get from your code, illustrate from
your own point of view if A* was useful or not to solve your
problem.

● Adding GUI (Interactive animations, game interface…etc.)
